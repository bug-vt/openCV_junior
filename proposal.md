## Abstract

## Introduction

Although computer vision is a relatively new topic, great amounts of time and effort have been put into by professionals and researchers in the last few decades. As a result, many sophisticated algorithms have been developed that most computer vision application are built upon today. Fortunately, those algorithms are packaged and encapsulated into commercial/open-source libraries, so that user can focus on its application.

As a student in Computer Vision course however, our goal is to gain concrete idea of some of the well-known topics in computer vision by creating our own library from scratch. Topics include Harris corner detector, SIFT descriptor, and nearest neighbor matching which lay foundation for many correspondence problem in computer vision. It is not our intention to create a library to compete with known library such as OpenCV, but to have stronger understanding of existing libraries and learn how to use correctly.
